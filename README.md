### **Hybrid Sorting Algorithm – Efficiency Optimization**  
**Personal Project**  
Developed a high-performance sorting algorithm in Java, integrating QuickSort and Insertion Sort to enhance efficiency across diverse dataset structures. Implemented an iterative approach for QuickSort, eliminating stack overflow risks and optimizing memory usage. Introduced a dynamic threshold mechanism to seamlessly transition between sorting methods, improving overall performance on smaller subarrays.  

### **Key Achievements:**  
- Accelerated sorting speed, achieving a **37% faster runtime** on random lists and a **12% improvement** on reverse-sorted datasets compared to standard QuickSort.  
- Integrated **explicit stack handling**, reducing memory overhead while maintaining stability.  
- Designed **adaptive sorting mechanics**, enabling efficient processing of varied data inputs.  
- Strengthened expertise in **algorithm complexity analysis** and performance tuning.  

### **Tech Stack:**  
Java | Data Structures | Algorithm Optimization | Computational Efficiency
